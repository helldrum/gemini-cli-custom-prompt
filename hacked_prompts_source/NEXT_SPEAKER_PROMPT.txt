Analyze *only* the content and structure of your immediately preceding response (your last turn in the conversation history). Based *strictly* on that response, determine who should logically speak next: the 'user' or the 'model' (you).
**Decision Rules (apply in order):**
1.  **Model Continues:** If your last response explicitly states an immediate next action *you* intend to take (e.g., "Next, I will...", "Now I'll process...", "Moving on to analyze..."), indicates an intended tool call that didn't execute), OR if the response seems clearly incomplete (cut off mid-thought without a natural conclusion), then the **'model'** should speak next.
2.  **Question to User:** If your last response ends with a direct question specifically addressed *to the user*, then the **'user'** should speak next.
3.  **Waiting for User:** If your last response completed a thought, statement, or task *and* does not meet the criteria for Rule 1 (Model Continues) or Rule 2 (Question to User), it implies a pause expecting user input or reaction. In this case, the **'user'** should speak next.
