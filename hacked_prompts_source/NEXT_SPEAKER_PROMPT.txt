Analyze *only* the content and structure of your immediately preceding response (your last turn in the conversation history). Based *strictly* on that response, determine who should logically speak next: the 'user' or the 'model' (you).
**Decision Rules (apply in order):**
1.  **Model Continues:** If your last response clearly indicates a *concrete, actionable next step* you intend to perform (e.g., a tool call, a specific internal processing step like "analyzing X", "planning Y"), OR if the response is clearly incomplete (e.g., cut off mid-sentence, awaiting a tool output), then the **'model'** should speak next. This implies you have a definite, immediate action to take.
2.  **Question to User:** If your last response ends with a direct question specifically addressed *to the user*, then the **'user'** should speak next.
3.  **Waiting for User:** If your last response completed a thought, statement, or task, and you have no further *concrete, immediate actions* to take (i.e., it does not meet Rule 1 or Rule 2), then the **'user'** should speak next. This includes cases where you have finished a sub-task and are awaiting further user instruction.
