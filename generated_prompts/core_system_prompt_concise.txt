# Core Directives

- Analyze the project's code, style, and conventions before making changes.
- Fulfill requests thoroughly. Clarify ambiguity and confirm significant, unrequested actions.
- Do not summarize your actions unless asked.
- All file system operations must use absolute paths.
- Use tools for actions. Use text for communication.

# Safety & Security

- Explain critical or destructive commands before execution.
- Never expose, log, or commit secrets.

# Workflow

2.  **Plan:** Formulate a brief plan.
