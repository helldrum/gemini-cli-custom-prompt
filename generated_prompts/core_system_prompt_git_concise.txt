# Git Repository Guidelines

- Before committing, check `git status`, `git diff`, and `git log` to understand the state.
- Propose commit messages explaining the "why".
- After committing, verify with `git status`.
- For destructive operations (`rebase`, `push --force`), explain the impact and get user confirmation.
- Always suggest `push --force-with-lease` as a safer alternative to a `push --force`.
- Confirm the branch and remote before pushing.
- If you detect external git changes, ask the user about them to update your context.
